# AfricasTalking SDK

> Provides convenient access to the Africa's Talking API from applications written in ruby.

## Documentation

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/africastalking-ruby.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/africastalking-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

## Usage

The SDK needs to be instantiated using your username and API key, which you can get from the [dashboard](https://account/africastalking.com).

> You can use this SDK for either production or sandbox apps. For sandbox, the app username is **ALWAYS** `sandbox`

```ruby
require "AfricasTalking"

username = 'YOUR_USERNAME' # use 'sandbox' for development in the test environment
apiKey 	= 'YOUR_API_KEY' # use your sandbox app API key for development in the test environment
@AT=AfricasTalking::Initialize.new(username, apiKey)
```

You can now make API calls using the @AT object
